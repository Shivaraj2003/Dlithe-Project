# Local Bus Management System

The Local Bus Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline various aspects of bus operations and passenger management. It provides features for passengers to query about available buses, apply for bus passes, and provide feedback. Bus managers can confirm, cancel, and update trips, while admins can verify bus pass applications and manage buses and trips. This system aims to improve the overall efficiency, transparency, and convenience of local bus services by leveraging modern technology.
